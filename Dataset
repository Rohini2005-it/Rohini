	•	Type: Tabular (structured)
	•	Entries: Each row represents data for a single student over a specific time period (weekly, monthly, or per course module).
	•	Focus: Student behavior and performance on the Applications of the Dataset

Using this dataset, educators and platforms can:
	•	Detect disengaged students (e.g., low logins, low video views).
	•	Identify struggling learners (e.g., low scores despite high engagement).
	•	Provide personalized interventions (e.g., extra videos, practice quizzes).
	•	Measure learning effectiveness (e.g., time spent vs. performance)
